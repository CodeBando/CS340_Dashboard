# CS340_Dashboard
This repository holds the project for a Dash Board program for Grazioso Salvare that allows them to access a MongoDB database to filter and search through the available animals in the Animal Shelters in the Austin Texas area to find trainable rescue dogs. 

## Project Review

#### Project Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure that the program was maintainable, I utilize best practices when developing the CRUD python module and the Dash Dashboard systems. This included developing the create/read/update/delete functionality that is utilized to access and manipulate a database as well as the functionality within the dashboard to access the CRUD module to display the information in the dashboard. By utilizing these best practices, the module is usable on any project that needs to access a MongoDB, allowing for the reusability of the module to fit any projects needs. I also executed OOP standards when developing the module to ensure abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism was utilized. <br>

To ensure my code was readable, I implemented standard naming conventions and executed commenting throughout the code base to provide informative and detailed information regarding the various components of the module and the dashboard program, allowing for users to better understand its functionality and enhance their ability to utilize for their own needs. <br>

By utilizing standard OOP components in both programs, I was able to create an adaptable system that could be manipulated to be utilized for other uses, quickly and effectively. By developing an endepth README file, I am able to provide the key information to users to help them understand its uses and how to update it to execute to their own requirements.

#### Approaching a Problem as a Computer Scientist
When approaching a problem, I have many process steps that I take. The first step is to review the project and its requirements in full, creating a checklist of the requirements to ensure that I fully understand the needs of the project. This gives me a detailed and easy to read document that I can review and compile questions that I have before beginning to execute the project. Once this has been developed, I start by building out a plan of execution, breaking out the various components that will need to be developed to successfully create the system. I can then take that breakout and start to wireframe out the system to ensure I have considered all the various needs. <br>

Once I have developed the wireframes and my plan of attack, I start by building out the various sections, completing extensive testing after each is developed to ensure they are functioning as expected. Regression testing is critical as each section is developed to ensure new errors or bugs are not being introduced into the system and accounting of unforeseen issues. After these sections are developed, they are combined to develop the final functional system that can be handed off to the client. <br>

The last step in my approach is documentation. Once the system has been developed, I complete extensive documenation covering everything from the project description, functionality, and updatability of the code base. By providing this documentation, I am able to provide the detailed information regarding the project to the end users in a format that allows for easy use and maintainability. <br>

In the case of this project, I was working with systems that I have never utilized in the past. To ensure I was able to successfully complete the work, I did a lot of research around the programs I would be utilizing, MongoDB and Jupyter Notebook, and their functionality. When developing the code in both systems, I utilized reference material to find the best solutions to the problems I was solving to ensure the system was successful and would be maintainable, readable, and adaptable. <br>

#### The Computer Scientists Role and Why it Matters
Computer scientists play a vital role in developing and applying computational techniques to solve complex problems, improve processes, and enhance various aspects of modern life through their work. It can encompass a wide range of activities which could include:<br>
* Software Development
* Hardware and Systems Development
* Data Analysis
* Cybersecurity
* Database Management
* UI/UX Developement
<br>
The work that a Computer Scientist does can help companies do their work more effectively and efficently in many ways. In regards to the work completed for this project, it can provide: <br>
<br>
<strong>Efficiences:</strong> Automating data management and visualization, the dashboard streamlines processes, saving time and effort for Grazioso Salvare. They can focus more on the animals that fit their specific criteria rather than manually going through every animal currently in the shelter system.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> The dashboard provides insights into shelter data, helping Grazioso Salvare make informed decisions about resource allocation, training operounities, and adoption strategies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Principles can be applied to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for the compainies staff to interact with the system.<br>
<br>
<strong>Scalability:</strong> Computer scientists can design the system to handle growth in data and users, ensuring it remains effective as Grazioso Salvare expands its operations.<br>
